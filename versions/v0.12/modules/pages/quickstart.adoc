Who needs documentation, lets just run this thing!

== Install

Fleet is distributed as a Helm chart. Helm 3 is a CLI, has no server side component, and its use is fairly straightforward. To install the Helm 3 CLI follow the https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install[official install instructions].

[CAUTION]

ifeval::["{build-type}" == "product"]
.<<_suse_rancher_prime_continous_delivery,{product_name}>> in Rancher
====
Rancher has separate helm charts for Fleet and uses a different repository.

[tabs]
======
Tab Linux/Mac::
+
[,bash]
----
brew install helm
helm repo add fleet https://rancher.github.io/fleet-helm-charts/
----

Tab Windows::
+
[,bash]
----
choco install kubernetes-helm
helm repo add fleet https://rancher.github.io/fleet-helm-charts/
----

======

Install the Fleet Helm charts (there's two because we separate out CRDs for ultimate flexibility.)
[,bash]
----
helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait fleet-crd \\ fleet/fleet-crd\n
helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait fleet \\ fleet/fleet`
----

== Add a Git Repo to Watch

Change `spec.repo` to your git repo of choice.  Kubernetes manifest files that should
be deployed should be in `/manifests` in your repo.

[,bash]
----
cat > example.yaml << "EOF"
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepo
metadata:
  name: sample
  # This namespace is special and auto-wired to deploy to the local cluster
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  # Everything from this repo will be run in this cluster. You trust me right?
  repo: "https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples"
  paths:
  - simple
EOF

kubectl apply -f example.yaml
----

== Get Status

ifeval::["{build-type}" == "product"]
Get status of what <<_suse_rancher_prime_continous_delivery,{product_name}>> is doing
endif::[]

ifeval::["{build-type}" == "community"]
Get status of what <<_continous_delivery,{product_name}>> is doing

endif::[] 

[,shell]
----
kubectl -n fleet-local get fleet
----

You should see something like this get created in your cluster.

[,shell]
----
kubectl get deploy frontend
----

[,shell]
----
NAME       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
frontend   3/3     3            3           116m

Do you need to...

* Monitor private git or Helm repositories? Check xref:gitrepo-add.adoc[this].
* Customise your deployments per target cluster? xref:gitrepo-targets.adoc[This page] will help.
