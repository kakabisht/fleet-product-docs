= Validate Fleet CLI Deployment
:revdate: 2025-10-6
:page-revdate: {revdate}

After applying a bundle using Fleet CLI, you can validate the deployment by inspecting the `Bundle` and its associated `BundleDeployments`.

Each {product_name}-managed cluster lists:

* Which bundles are deployed to it.  
* Their readiness status.  
* Any errors or synchronization issues.

To validate whether your `fleet apply` created a bundle and whether it was deployed to the correct number of targets, run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get bundles.fleet.cattle.io -A
----

You’ll see the following fields:

* `BUNDLEDEPLOYMENTS-READY` — Shows how many targets are ready out of the total.  
* `STATUS` — May show *Ready*, *Modified*, or other conditions based on the rollout.

[NOTE]
====
If `BUNDLEDEPLOYMENTS-READY` shows `1/1`, the bundle is successfully deployed to one cluster.
====

To get a detailed view of how the bundle was rendered and applied, run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get bundles.fleet.cattle.io -n fleet-local my-nginx-bundle -o yaml
----

Look for the following fields in the `status` section:

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  display:
    readyClusters: 1/1
  summary:
    desiredReady: 1
    ready: 1
  conditions:
    type: Ready
    status: "True"
----

This indicates that:

* The bundle was scheduled for one cluster.  
* The target cluster acknowledged and applied the resources.  
* The controller marked the deployment as ready.

You can also verify the corresponding `BundleDeployment` object, since each `BundleDeployment` corresponds to a target cluster:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get bundledeployments.fleet.cattle.io -A
----
