= Fine Tuning Error Detection
:revdate: 2025-09-12
:page-revdate: {revdate}

{product_name} monitors the `status` field of deployed resources to determine whether a `Bundle` is healthy or in error. In certain cases, Fleet may interpret a condition in the status field as an error, even if it is expected or harmless.

You can adjust this behavior in two ways:

* Ignore conditions in `fleet.yaml`
* Customize error mappings with environment variables

NOTE: 
You should rarely need to configure readiness detection in {product_name} with environment variables. If you do, open an issue or submit a pull request to help improve the default readiness detection.

== Ignore conditions in `fleet.yaml`

Use the `ignore.conditions` setting in the `fleet.yaml` file to tell {product_name} to ignore specific conditions.

[source,yaml]
----
# from https://fleet.rancher.io/ref-fleet-yaml

# Ignore fields when monitoring a Bundle. This can be used when {product_name} thinks
# some conditions in Custom Resources makes the Bundle to be in an error state
# when it shouldn't.
ignore:

  # Conditions to be ignored
  conditions:

    # In this example a condition will be ignored if it contains
    # {"type": "Active", "status", "False"}
    - type: Active
      status: "False"
----

This method is useful when a custom resource or controller sets conditions that cause {product_name} to mark a Bundle as failed, even though the resource is healthy.

== Configure error mapping with environment variables

In {product_name} **v0.13**, error detection was enhanced to give you more control. You can use the environment variable `CATTLE_WRANGLER_CHECK_GVK_ERROR_MAPPING` to customize how resource conditions are interpreted.

This variable lets you define, by `Group`, `Version`, `Kind` (GVK), which condition values should be treated as errors or explicitly not treated as errors.

Set this variable in your Fleet Helm chart deployment (`values.yaml`) using `extraEnv`. The value must be JSON.

[source,yaml]
----
# Extra environment variables passed to the fleet pods.
# extraEnv:
# - name: OCI_STORAGE
#   value: "false"
----

NOTE: 
This setting is global to all Fleet controllers and applies to every `GitRepo`. If you need to adjust error handling only for a specific Bundle, use the `ignoreConditions` option in `fleet.yaml` instead.

=== Merging behavior

When you override mappings with `CATTLE_WRANGLER_CHECK_GVK_ERROR_MAPPING`:

* New Conditions are merged with predefined conditions.
* Condition values are replaced for any condition you redefine.

For example, consider the Default mapping: 

`HelmChart.Failed=["True"]`

This means `Failed=True` is treated as an error.

When you override with:

* `HelmChart.Failed=["False"]`
* `HelmChart.Ready=["False"]`

This results in:

* `Failed=["False"]` replaces the default mapping. This means **`Failed=False`** is now treated as an error.
* `Ready=["False"]` is added, so **`Ready=False`** is also treated as an error.
* Other conditions unchanged.

=== Disable error interpretation example

Assume that every value of `Failed` was previously interpreted as an error, for example:

[source,json]
----
{ "type": "Failed", "status": ["True", "False"] }
----

You can narrow this mapping to treat only `Failed=True` as an error by setting:

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "gvk": "sample.cattle.io/v1, Kind=Sample",
    "conditionMappings": [
      { "type": "Failed", "status": ["True"] } 
    ]
  }
]
----

This configuration means only **`Failed=True`** is treated as an error. `Failed=False` is no longer considered an error.

You can also disable errors for any value of `Failed` by:

[source,json]
----
{ "type": "Failed", "status": [""] } 
----

This configuration ensures that **no value of `Failed`** is treated as an error.

NOTE: 
Overriding conditions only affects the default error mappings (refer to xref:default-error-mappings[Default error mappings]). {product_name} may still mark a resource as an error because other checks, such as those from the `kstatus` library, continue to run after your customization.

=== Enable error interpretation example

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "gvk": "sample.cattle.io/v1, Kind=Sample",
    "conditionMappings": [
      { "type": "Failed", "status": ["True"] }
    ]
  }
]
----

Here, `Failed=True` is treated as an error.

[[default-error-mappings]]
== Default error mappings 

{product_name} adds default error mappings to interpret certain resource conditions in the `status` field as errors. These mappings are applied besides other readiness checks, such as those performed by the Kubernetes `kstatus` library.

The following default mappings apply:

* **HelmChart** (`helm.cattle.io/v1`)
  * `JobCreated`: Neither `True` nor `False` is considered an error.
  * `Failed`: `True` is considered an error.
* **Node** (`v1`)
  * `OutOfDisk`: `True` is considered an error.
  * `MemoryPressure`: `True` is considered an error.
  * `DiskPressure`: `True` is considered an error.
  * `NetworkUnavailable`: `True` is considered an error.
* **Deployment** (`apps/v1`)
  * `ReplicaFailure`: `True` is considered an error.
  * `Progressing`: `False` is considered an error.
* **ReplicaSet** (`apps/v1`)
  * `ReplicaFailure`: `True` is considered an error.

=== Fallback mapping

If a resource does not match the listed GVKs, {product_name} applies a fallback mapping:

* Any `Group` and `Version` with any kind
  * `Stalled`: `True` is considered an error.
  * `Failed`: `True` is considered an error.
