= Install and Use Fleet CLI
:revdate: 2025-10-6
:page-revdate: {revdate}

{product_name} CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to interact directly with {product_name} from your local machine. It enables you to create, apply, and inspect `bundles` without requiring a `GitRepo`. Typical use cases include:

* Testing and previewing bundle contents.
* Creating bundles directly from Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, and `fleet.yaml` files.
* Checking which clusters a bundle would target.
* Validating deployments without installing {product_name} in the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can use `fleet apply` without installing {product_name} in your clusters. However, for cluster interaction (for example, `fleet target`, `fleet deploy`), {product_name} must be installed.

For more information, see xref:../how-tos-for-operators/installation.adoc[Install Fleet].

== Install Fleet CLI

Fleet CLI is a stand-alone binary that you can download from the xref:https://github.com/rancher/fleet/releases[Fleet GitHub releases page].

=== Linux/macOS

[source,bash]
----
curl -L -o fleet https://github.com/rancher/fleet/releases/latest/download/fleet-linux-amd64

# Make it executable and move to PATH
chmod +x fleet
sudo mv fleet /usr/local/bin/
----

=== Windows (PowerShell)

[source,powershell]
----
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/rancher/fleet/releases/latest/download/fleet-windows-amd64.exe" -OutFile "fleet.exe"
----

=== Verify installation

[source,bash]
----
fleet --version
----

== Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed and configured:

* A working Kubernetes cluster (for example, k3s, kind, or a cloud provider).
* `kubectl` is configured for your cluster.
* Helm is installed.
* Fleet CLI is installed and accessible in your terminal.

=== Verify prerequisites

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get nodes
helm version
fleet --version
----

== Key Commands

{product_name} provides several CLI commands to create, preview, and deploy bundles. These commands are useful for debugging and understanding the bundle lifecycle.

* `fleet apply`: Creates or previews a bundle from local files, such as a Helm chart, Kubernetes manifests, or kustomize folders.  
This command does not require access to a cluster, so it works even without {product_name} or `kubectl` installed.
+
Example:
[source,bash]
----
fleet apply my-bundle ./manifests
----
* `fleet target`: Reads a bundle file and evaluates which clusters would receive it, based on selectors and targeting rules such as `targets`, `targetOverrides`, `clusterGroups`, and label selectors.
+
Example:
[source,bash]
----
fleet target my-bundle ./manifests
----
* `fleet deploy`: Takes the output of `fleet target`, or a dumped `bundledeployment`/content resource, and deploys it to a cluster—just like `fleet-agent` would.
+
You can use it in these scenarios:
** `fleet apply -o - name ./folder` to check the YAML of the bundle before creating it. For more information, see xref:../explanations/ref-bundle-stages.adoc#examining-the-bundle-lifecycle-with-the-cli[Examining the Bundle Lifecycle with the CLI].
** Use with a target to debug selectors and verify which downstream clusters are targeted.
** `fleet deploy --dry-run` to print resources that would be deployed, without applying them.

== Deploy a Sample Bundle Using Fleet CLI

You can deploy workloads without using GitRepos by applying them locally with the CLI. For example, use the xref:https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples[Fleet examples repository]:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples
cd fleet-examples/single-cluster
----

Apply it to the current cluster:

[source,bash]
----
fleet apply -o my-cool-bundle manifests
----

This command creates a `Bundle` resource in the namespace.

== Convert a Helm Chart into a Bundle

You can use Fleet CLI to convert a Helm chart into a bundle. For example, to convert the *external-secrets* operator chart:

[source,bash]
----
cat > targets.yaml <<EOF
targets:
- clusterSelector: {}
EOF

mkdir app
cat > app/fleet.yaml <<EOF
defaultNamespace: external-secrets
helm:
  repo: https://charts.external-secrets.io
  chart: external-secrets
EOF

fleet apply --compress --targets-file=targets.yaml -n fleet-default -o - external-secrets app > eso-bundle.yaml

kubectl apply -f eso-bundle.yaml
----

Make sure you use a cluster selector in `targets.yaml` that matches all clusters you want to deploy to.

For more information, refer to xref;https://www.suse.com/c/rancher_blog/fleet-multi-cluster-deployment-with-the-help-of-external-secrets/[Fleet: Multi-Cluster Deployment with the Help of External Secrets].

== Troubleshooting

If the bundle is not ready:

* Check if `fleet-controller` and `fleet-agent` pods are running.
* Make sure the `fleet-local` cluster is registered.
* Inspect the bundle for error messages:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl describe bundle -n fleet-local <bundle-name>
----
* Delete and reapply the bundle if you encounter Helm ownership conflicts.

=== Verify Agent and Controller Status

Before troubleshooting bundle or deployment issues, verify that the Fleet agent is registered and running on the downstream cluster.  
For more information, see xref:../reference/ref-registration.adoc#fleet-agent-is-registered-watches-for-bundledeployments[Fleet Agent is Registered, Watches for BundleDeployments].

If a bundle is not ready on a given cluster, check the following:

* On the management cluster:
** Verify that the `fleet-controller` and `gitjob` pods (or `helmops`, depending on your setup) are running.
** Ensure the cluster status shows *Ready*.
** Check the status of the bundle—it should contain an error message if deployment failed.
* On the target cluster where the bundle isn’t ready:
** Verify that this target cluster is registered and has a running `fleet-agent` pod.
** As a last resort, check the logs of the `fleet-agent` pod.
