== Status Fields

Fleet reports most information via status fields on its custom resources.
These fields are also used by the Rancher UI to display information about the state of the resources.

See xref:reference/ref-status-fields.adoc[status fields reference] for more information on status fields and conditions.

== K8s Events

Fleet will generate K8s events a user can subscribe to. This is the list of events:

* `Created`- a new git cloning job is created
* `GotNewCommit`- a git repository has a new commit
* `JobDeleted`- a successful git cloning job is removed
* `FailedValidatingSecret`- a git cloning job cannot be created, because a required secret is missing
* `FailedToApplyRestrictions`- the GitRepo resource violates the GitRepoRestriction resource's rules
* `FailedToCheckCommit`- cannot get latest commit from the git server
* `FailedToGetGitJob`- cannot retrieve information from the git cloning job
* `Failed`- polling is disabled, triggered via webhook, but cannot get latest commit from the git server

== Metrics

Fleet publishes Prometheus metrics. They can be retrieved from these services:

* `monitoring-fleet-controller.cattle-fleet-system.svc.cluster.local:8080/metrics`
* `monitoring-gitjob.cattle-fleet-system.svc.cluster.local:8081/metrics`

The https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/metrics-reference[collection of exported metrics] includes all the information from controller-runtime, like the number of reconciled resources, the number of errors, and the time it took to reconcile.

=== Grafana

When using Grafana and Prometheus (for example, from https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts), some setup is needed to access Fleet metrics.

. Create a `ServiceMonitor` resource to scrape Fleet metrics. Here is an example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  # Create this in the same namespace as your application
  namespace: cattle-fleet-system
  name: fleet-controller-monitor
  labels:
    # This label makes the ServiceMonitor discoverable by the Prometheus Operator
    release: monitoring  # <-- ADD THIS LABEL!
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      # This label must exist on the service you want to scrape
      app: fleet-controller # Assumed label, verify this
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      # We are only looking for the service in its own namespace
      - cattle-fleet-system
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    path: /metrics
    interval: 30s
---
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  # Create this in the same namespace as your application
  namespace: cattle-fleet-system
  name: fleet-gitjob-monitor
  labels:
    # This label makes the ServiceMonitor discoverable by the Prometheus Operator
    release: monitoring  # <-- ADD THIS LABEL!
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      # This label must exist on the service you want to scrape
      app: gitjob
  namespaceSelector:
    matchNames:
      # We are only looking for the service in its own namespace
      - cattle-fleet-system
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    path: /metrics
    interval: 30s
----
+
And apply the manifest in Fleet's namespace, for example in ++cattle-fleet-system++:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create -f servicemonitor.yaml -n cattle-fleet-system
----

. Build the Grafana dashboards and import them into Grafana. You can find the dashboards in the https://github.com/rancher/fleet-dashboards[fleet-dashboards repository]. Follow the README instructions to build them.
